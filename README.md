**So, you started learning Python. Now what?**

The [Python for Journalists MOOC](https://datajournalism.com/watch/python-for-journalists) I got to create for [Datajournalism.com](https://datajournalism.com) has found its way to journalists eager to learn Python. Which off course is great. But when you're done with that course, what's next?

In this living repository I'll collect Jupyter Notebooks that contain code that I actually wrote and used in the newsroom. To make sure it will help you learn Python, I'll add comments, links and tips to my code. If I do this right, my code should become a workbook in which you can practice. :)

Some Notebooks will be in Dutch, others will be in English. An overview of all of them can be found here:


| Notebook| Content | Language |
| :------------- |:-------------|:-----:|
| [200923 Webscraping with Python - Dataharvest 2020.ipynb](https://github.com/winnydejong/next/blob/master/200923%20Webscraping%20with%20Python%20-%20Dataharvest%202020%20%5Bcomplete%5D.ipynb) | This Notebook contains a scraper to collect all [the program](dataharvesteijc2020.sched.com/) of the 2020 [DataHarvest+ European Investigative Journalism Conference](https://dataharvest.eu/). It was created for a DataHarvest+ [session on Python](https://dataharvesteijc2020.sched.com/event/dkjh/data-analysis-with-pandas-on-jupyter-3?iframe=no), taught together with the [wonderful Adriana Homolova](https://github.com/zufanka). FYI: There also exists an [empty version of this notebook](https://github.com/winnydejong/next/blob/master/200923%20Webscraping%20with%20Python%20-%20Dataharvest%202020%20%5Bempty%5D.ipynb). (Oh, and a final note, you'll find all [material used in the Python sessions of DataHarvest+ 2020](https://github.com/zufanka/DataAnalysisPython_DataHarvest2020) taught by Adriana and yours truly here.) | EN |
